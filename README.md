## Tech Stack
To create this personal portfolio, I used React.js and TailwindCSS to create the components and the layout of this project. Because this was just a personal portfolio website, there is no backend portion for this project. Additionally, I used Github Actions to create a CI/CD pipeline to build and publish the website.
